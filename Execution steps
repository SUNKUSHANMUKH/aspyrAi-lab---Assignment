THE PROCESS OF EXECUTION CAN BE EXPLAINED IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS.
        To obtain the process they divided into different categories.
                the process is: 
                     1. connect the script (code) to the local host using the root---> those the user cerenditals.
                     2. if successfully connected then you can see in the screen and you can see the data are driven from the tables.
                     3. Then, the data is organized in the dictionary and converted into JSON format, and the JSON structure is written in the .json(Extention).
                     4. if any errors occur then you can see on the screen about the errors.
                     5. Finally, it closes the database connection and cursor to ensure no lingering connections.

                     
The resulting data.json file will contain the fetched data from the three tables in a structured JSON format, making it easy to use or share further.
